        <h1>3am Dream That changed everything</h1>

        <figcaption>“3:07 AM. My brain whispered what I was too busy to hear while awake.”</figcaption>
        <p>It wasn’t even a nightmare. It wasn’t terrifying. Just… familiar.
I was standing in a long, dim hallway lined with locked doors. Some were slightly cracked open,
 others were chained shut, and all of them felt like versions of me I didn’t want to deal with.
  The air was heavy, like my lungs forgot how to breathe without effort. The lights above
 buzzed and flickered, stuttering like my thoughts on a bad day 
 — tired, glitchy, and too loud.<br>
 Each door whispered something different.<br>
"You should’ve replied to that message."<br>
"You’re falling behind."<br>
"Why can’t you just be normal?"<br>
"You’re so dramatic. Get over it."<br>
"You’re disappointing everyone."<br>

I didn’t know which one to open, but I felt like I had to choose. That pressure — 
the need<i>to fix something, to prove I was okay</i>  — 
it built until my hand finally reached for a door.
 The second I touched the handle,
 the hallway cracked. The floor shook. 
 The walls trembled like they were about to cave in on me.
 And just before everything shattered, I heard a voice.
Not loud. Not scary. Just quiet and exhausted.
It said:<br>
“You’ve been holding the weight of rooms you never needed to enter.”<br>

I woke up.<br>
3:07 AM.<br>
Breath short.<br>
Tears on my face.<br>
Heart racing.<br>

And it hit me.<br>

I wasn’t just tired.<br>
I wasn’t just “not feeling like myself.”<br>
I was burned out — emotionally, mentally, completely.<br>
That hallway? That was my mind.<br>
All those doors? Expectations I chained myself to.<br>
Versions of me I kept trying to unlock and fix, all at once.<br>
No wonder I couldn’t breathe.<br><br>

That dream didn’t give me a solution.<br>
It gave me permission.<br>
To stop performing.<br>
To stop trying to earn rest.<br>
To stop opening doors that only drain me.<br><br>

Since that night, I’ve started doing less. Saying “no” without a reason. Resting without apologizing.
And every now and then, I still picture that hallway —
but now, I walk past the doors without needing to touch them.<br>

Because healing doesn’t always look loud or obvious.
<b>Sometimes it just looks like choosing peace —
and letting go of what was never mine to carry.</b>
